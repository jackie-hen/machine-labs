3 themes for the class clock
1. Windows Outside - looking into a window and out at the same time
2. Snow Globe - a microcosm of a small scene
3. Waves - exploring rhythm and movement in machines (clockwork)

5 possible topics to research for this course
1. Whittling - putting a personal touch on the final project with a handmade figure or two. There are tons of scraps waiting to be whittled and many carving kits to work with.
2. Bandsaw - a more dangerous machine than the table or circular saw, but it allows a variety of cuts with more precision. If students plan to make certain shapes, it's good to learn about this in advance and request training early!
3. Walter Niedermayr - a photographer who has an interesting take on segmented art. He describes natural themes through the segmentation of landscapes and highlights human presence in architecture and nature. While it's not immediately relevant to the media at hand in this course, the artistic approach could apply to make our pieces more cohesive. https://walterniedermayr.com/
4. CNC - Many students would benefit from implementing this machinery in their projects, but it's an incredibly complex machine with finicky but impressive software. Researching this ahead of time will likely save scene shop assistants a great amount of time.
5. The white cube - this is an art history term that refers to the way museums tend to highlight diverse works with a simple and boring white museum display. Unfortunately, this technique has been proven to be disorienting and ineffective.
